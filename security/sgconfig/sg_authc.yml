# This is the main Search Guard configuration file where authentication for the REST interface of OpenSearch is defined.
# 
# You need to configure at least one authentication domain in this file.
# An authentication domain is responsible for extracting the user credentials from 
# the request and for validating them against an authentication backend like Active Directory for example. 
#
# If more than one authentication domain is configured the first one which succeeds wins. 
# If all authentication domains fail then the request is unauthenticated.
# In this case an exception is thrown and/or the HTTP status is set to 401.
# 
# For authentication for the transport client, see sg_authc_transport.yml.
# 
# See the documentation for more details: 
# https://docs.search-guard.com/latest/authentication-authorization
