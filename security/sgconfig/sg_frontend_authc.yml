# This file defines the authentication frontends for Kibana. 
#
# If you want to login a username/password login form, you can leave this file as it is. The authentication backends used for 
# verifying the username and password, are configured in sg_authc.yml.
#
# If you want to use SAML or OIDC based authentication, you have to provide additional configuration here. You can use the configuration 
# examples below as a starting point.
# 
# NOTE: For using SAML or OIDC based authentication on production systems, you have to obtain a license.
# See:  https://docs.search-guard.com/latest/search-guard-enterprise-edition
# 
# You can use any number of authentication methods at once. Search Guard will present you a selection of all available authentication methods in the browser.
#
# If you use more than one Kibana instance, you can add additonal root entries besides the default entry. In kibana.yml you can then select the configuration
# to be used by the config option searchguard.sg_frontend_config_id
#
# See https://docs.search-guard.com/tech-preview/kibana-authentication-types for detailed documentation
